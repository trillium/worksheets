# KPI for (Disillusioned) Individuals

This worksheet is for employees who want to define how they will provide value to their company in the next three months. The slant of the worksheet assumes that the employee is currently _unhappy_ with their role within the organisation. This worksheet was originally created as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10E0PDvrOvoSNN0WRtw_62wS8aUll5ngCtn6ZlViC9bA/).

## Meeting Outcomes

- Define positive elements of working at your current company.
- Define negative elements of working at your current company.
- Identify which of the negative elements are within my control and can be fixed.
- Create a 3 month plan to measure progress improvements.

### Timeline

- Start date: today
- Checkpoint 1: [add one month]
- Checkpoint 2: [add one month]
- End date: [add one month]

## What’s Good About Where You Work Now?

- Create a bullet list of all the things you like about your current job / role / company.
- You may also choose to add neutral items to this list.
- Something can be both good AND bad. Put it in both places if it's appropriate.

## What’s Bad About Where You Work Now?

- Create a bullet list of all the things you like about your current job / role / company.
- You may also choose to add neutral items to this list.
- Something can be both good AND bad. Put it in both places if it's appropriate.

## Is It Within My Control?

When determining what to work on, it is crucial that you focus on things _you_ can affect. If something is outside of your control, you will need to let it go, or escalate the problem to someone who can deal with it. This task of sorting allows us to focus on brainstorming as a skill that is separate from analysis. Most of the things that you want to work were probably listed in the "bad" section previously. If they are all outside of your control, it is possible you are not in the right role at your company.

Steps:

1. Copy elements from the previous section to the appropriate box.

Yes | No
--- | ---

2. Choose 3-5 things from the “yes” category to focus on.

Ideally these elements will make you happier, and make the company more productive (improve efficiencies which result in a more profitable business) ... because when the business does well, you stay employed.

## How Can I Measure This Problem?

For example: raw numbers; % change; % progress toward final goal. Don’t think it can be measured? Don’t try to fix it. Think it’s important to fix? Refer to [How to Measure Anything](http://www.howtomeasureanything.com/).

## What Actions Will I Take Towards Removing This Problem?

## What If Nothing Happens?

It won’t be nothing that changes (if absolutely nothing changes, then I have not been making a “good faith” effort). Jot down your action plan if nothing has changed, and your anticipated outcomes have not been achieved. Will you change your tactics? Will you ask for help (from the same people? from new people?)?

## What is the minimum change I require to be happy?

Sometimes we get into a trap of complaining, and even if things improve, we find new things to complain about. Write a description of what things are like at work when all the problems are fixed. What is the atmosphere at work like? What is business like (from a sales perspective)? What does your daily work day look like?

## What’s My Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)?

If things _aren't_ improving, what are your alternatives? For more information on the concept of a BATNA, read: [Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement](http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/batna).

## What’s My Deadline?

Don't let things drag on. Set yourself a deadline today, and if things aren't working, be prepared to change roles or quit on this date.
